This is not just a Face recogition system, but an intelligent system that can be used to put the system in to lockdown and detect unknown faces and store them in case of intrusion.

We have created a Project Report pdf document for detailed explanations including References.
We have also created a ppt for quick understanding of the methodology.
We have created a Concept Description pdf for going throught the thought and the various actions performed by the model.

The steps should be:
1. GUI.py will fire up the GUI and from there every other action can be performed.
2. Descriptions of every button, in the GUI is provided in the Project Report (with accompanying Screenshots) and their workflow with added questions are provided in the Concept Description pdf and the Final Report ppt.
3. Step by step execution with pictures is present in the Report.
4. The model needs data for training and detecting purposes and the images of new persnos can be captured from withing the GUI by triggering the Laptop Webcam and those images are stored in the Images folder.
5. The IntrusionDetected folder stores images of people who's faces are not recognised (the model has not been trained for thsoe faces).

Future Work :
We will make sure to include a feature which will email the pictures taken to the main userâ€™s mobile or post it on a mobile application. 
As an additional security measure, we will trigger an alarm which can be only turned off if the user activates unlocking mechanism from its end.
